The near global lock down caused by COVID-19 means that most software developers are working from home. Some of
are missing taking coffee and shooting the breeze. So I decided to organize a virtual coffee morning to give 
people a chance to do that.

### The Open / Closed Principal

At the moment my coffee morning is open to anyone. But I think there's probably an optimal number of people for online chatting somewhere between 2 and 8. So if the group becomes successful I'll make it invite only. Invites will need to be renewed to allow rotation of people.

So that everyone who wants to can benefit from a virtual coffee morning I encourage other people to organize one and add the details here. To do this sent a [PR here](https://github.com/programmers-coffee-morning/programmers-coffee-morning).

### Dylan's Advice On Platforms

Don't know what platform to use? Here's Dylan's advice:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Try using a different platform each week until you find one that works well for your people. Jitsi, Whereby, GoToMeeting, Teams, Hangouts, Skype, Bluejeans, Discord, WebEx all have their strengths and weaknesses (as indeed does Zoom) - and the comparative data is useful.</p>&mdash; Dylan Beattie üá™üá∫ @ üè° (@dylanbeattie) <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/1249308389630410752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
